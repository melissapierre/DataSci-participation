## Repository definition 
A **repository** is a central file location that is used by organizations and individuals to store and manage data. Repositories such as Github are mainly used for its version control systems that store multiple versions of files. This allows users to easily revise, look at changes and maintain documentation. Repositories are often stored on servers, which can be accessed by multiple users.

# Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is Melissa Pierre :smiley: I am currently a senior majoring in Psychology. I am interested in neuroscience, cognitive psychology and pretty much everything that can affect memory, learning, and behavior. I love to know more about human cognition by learning and conducting research in the Emac lab supervised by Dr. Schotter. After getting my BA in 2020, I am hoping to attend graduate school to get a degree in neuropsychology.

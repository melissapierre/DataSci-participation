## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

'''{r}
install.packages('gapminder')
install.packages('DT')
install.packages('tibble')
'''
```{r}
# library(gapminder)
# library(tibble)
# library(DT)
```

```{r}
mtcars
```
mtcars is a dataset describing the features of automobiles from an old magazine. it has 7 variables. 



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```
```{r}
(mtcars$cyl)
```
```{r}
mean(mtcars$cyl)
```
```{r}
# library(gapminder)
# library(tibble)
# library(DT)
```

```{r}
install.packages(prettydoc)
```
